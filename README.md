# Bad‑Kitty — Cat‑on‑Counter Vision Prototype

A small, humane robot project to discourage cats from walking on kitchen counters.  
**Phases 0–1:** setup + the vision prototype (detect “cat on countertop” inside a polygon ROI), with snapshots/logging and safety‑minded detection guards (persistence + cooldown). No actuation yet.
